Hi, I'm Ben. I graduated in medicine in the Summer and after some reflection, I realized that I was better suited to helping people by solving problems using maths and logic.  As such, I have started to learn SQL and python on DataCamp, and I am very much enjoying it! I have built this website to showcase my learning and projects, and hopefully it will solidify some of the knowledge in my head along the way. I've always enjoyed playing games with challenging puzzles like The Legend of Zelda, especially in those moments where you've solved the puzzle and the signature music plays. This has made me think that going into data and analytics would really play to my strengths.

I'm a keen football fan, especially when it comes to England football. Last Summer I went to Germany with some friends to see England in the Euros, unfortunately to the 2 of the boring group games! But the atmosphere was like nothing I'd ever experienced. I also love anything to do with films and cinema, my favourite film being Christopher Nolan's Interstellar.
