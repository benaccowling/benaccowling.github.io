# Introduction

This project is the first of those I have completed in my data science master's degree. It was an excellent way of bringing together the full workflow of building a machine learning model that I have learned throughout the module. My lecturers emphasized the importance of justifying decisions made when building the model so that it was the best fit for its use case. My background in medicine allowed me to do this, leading to a mark of 74 on this project.

To improve on this model, I could have tested the effectiveness of my feature selection to reduce noise in the data, as well as using explainable AI tools to make the random forest more explainable.
