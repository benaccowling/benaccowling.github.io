    <p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Ben. I graduated in medicine in the Summer and after some reflection, I realized that I was better suited to helping people by solving problems using maths and logic.  As such, I have started to learn SQL and python on DataCamp, and I am very much enjoying it! I have built this website to showcase my learning and projects, and hopefully it will solidify some of the knowledge in my head along the way. I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed playing games like The Legend of Zelda, especially in those moments where you&rsquo;ve solved the puzzle and the signature music plays. This has made me think that going into data and analytics would really play to my strengths.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a keen football fan, especially when it comes to England football. Last Summer I went to Germany with some friends to see England in the Euros, unfortunately to the 2 of the boring group games! But the atmosphere was like nothing I&rsquo;d ever experienced. I also love anything to do with films and cinema, my favourite film being Christopher Nolan&rsquo;s Interstellar.</p>
